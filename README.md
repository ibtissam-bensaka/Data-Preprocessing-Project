# Data-Preprocessing-Project
In many domains such as computer vision or pattern recognition, solving a problem is based on processing data extracted from a set of real world data acquired by means of sensors or resulting from some data processing.
Data are structured as vectors. The quality of a processing system highly depends on the choice of these vector content. However, in many cases the vectorsâ€™ high dimensionality makes it almost impossible to use them to solve the problem, both because of the data themselves and of the learning set size. Hence, it is usually recommended, and sometimes required to reduce the vector size in order to make them more usable, even if the reduction might lead to information loss. Sometimes, solving complex problems with large descriptors can also be accomplished using a small set of features selected from initial data set. This can be done if the selected features are relevant with respect to the considered problem. Reducing vector dimensionality is often considered as a pre-processing essential step dedicated to noise and redundant information elimination.
In this project, we will be interested in two dimensionality reduction methods, we will apply it to two different datasets.
